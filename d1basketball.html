    <h1>Mason's D1 Basketball Journey</h1>
    <a href="index.html" class="back">Back</a>
    
    <p> Mason, 15, dreamed of playing Division I basketball, but despite his determination, he struggled
    to match the natural talent of his peers. With his signature fluffy hair bouncing as he ran drills, 
    Mason focused on improving his skills through hard work, often feeling frustrated when his shots didnâ€™t 
    fall as easily as his friends'. But Mason kept pushing himself, knowing the effort was what counted. By the 
    end of the season, Mason was not the biggest, fastest or the strongest, but his mentality was what made him a 
    standout hooper. He made the team, and saw real improvement, realizing that persistence and resilience, not 
    perfection, were the key to reaching his dreams. Mason was even quoted saying; "Mr. Palmer doesn't know my true
    potential". And boy was he right on that one. </p>
