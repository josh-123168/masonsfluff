        <h2>Mason The Fluffy Hair Demon</h2>
        <h3>A Poem...</h3>
        <hr class="poem">

        <p>In a little old town where the sun shines bright,
        Lived a boy named Mason, the purest of delights.
        With laughter like music, he’d skip and he’d play,
        But it was his <span class="fluffy-text">fluffy</span> hair that stole the day.</p>
        <p>Curls that bounced like clouds in the sky,
        Golden and soft, they caught every eye.
        When the wind danced gently, his hair would twirl,
        A halo of sunshine, a magical whirl.</p>
        <p>Friends gathered 'round to admire his crown,
        “Look at that <span class="fluffy-text">fluff</span>!” they’d cheer with a frown.
        “Why can’t ours be like yours, so light and so free?”
        Mason just laughed, “It’s just part of me!”</p>
        <p>He’d wear it with pride, a <span class="fluffy-text">fluffy</span> array,
        Turning heads as he ran and played all day.
        Through fields of wildflowers and splashes of streams,
        His hair caught the sunlight like dreams catching beams.</p>
        <p>At dusk, when the stars sprinkled light in the air,
        Mason would smile, his heart full of care.
        For it wasn’t just hair that made him so bright,
        But the joy that he spread, a warm, golden light.</p>
        <p>So here’s to young Mason, with hair full of cheer,
        A reminder that happiness is always near.
        In a world full of wonders, both big and small,
        It’s Mason's <span class="fluffy-text">fluffy</span> hair that can bring joy to all!</p>
